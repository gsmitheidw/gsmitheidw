### Notable Project Repos
- [pogo-s2-kildare](https://github.com/gsmitheidw/pogo-s2-kildare)  
Mapping for Pok√©mon Go using the S2 cell structure. Set to Kildare Ireland, but can be set to any location.  
This allows you to manually plot Pok√©Stops, Gyms and non-Pogo items onto your local area as an alternative  
to IITC and equivalent solutions since the breakaway from Ingress/Niantic to Scopely. 
- [go-ssh-copy-id](https://github.com/gsmitheidw/go-ssh-copy-id)  
Something I felt Windows really lacks is an equivalent of ssh-copy-id which is native in Linux/Unix
- [GenealogyTools](https://github.com/gsmitheidw/GenealogyTools)  
A few tools to help with processing DNA matches and genealogy, mostly with Gedmatch kits and DNA Painting
- [termux.properties](https://github.com/gsmitheidw/termux.properties)  
A better default termux toolbar. Removes the backspace bell sound which is annoying.
